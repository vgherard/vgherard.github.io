I am Valerio, class 1992, born in Italy and based in Valencia (Spain).

My formal education is in [Theoretical Physics](physics.html), but my current
occupation is in Data Analysis and, more specifically, Product Analytics. I work as Data Scientist in [Voicemod](https://www.voicemod.net/).

I use this space to share little notes, mainly about statistics, mathematics, physics, whatever^[*Physics is an experimental science, a part of natural science. Mathematics is the part of physics where experiments are cheap.* - V.I. Arnold, On Teaching Mathematics.] . Despite my official role, I'm actually pretty much a rookie statistician, which makes the [explorations I share on this website](index.html) much more enjoyable to me, I guess ðŸ˜¼. I also like [messing with statistical code, usually in R](code.html).
