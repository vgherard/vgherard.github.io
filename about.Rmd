I am Valerio, class 1992, born in Italy and living in Valencia (Spain) with my girlfriend.

I am a [Theoretical Physicist](physics.html) turned Data Scientist, currently employed at [Voicemod](https://www.voicemod.net/). I play piano, I enjoy long walks, I dislike closed empty space and empty space in general.

In my day to day work, I mainly program with Python, SQL, R and Bash, to which I couple BI tools such as Tableau, Looker and Amplitude. [For my personal/fun projects](code.html), I spend most of my coding time in R (with which I manage this website itself) and C++, but I also enjoy delving into Python.

If you want to get in touch, you can follow the contact links in the navigation bar above. My CV can be downloaded [here](cv/cv.pdf).
