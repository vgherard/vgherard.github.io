I am Valerio, class 1992, born in Italy and living in Valencia (Spain) with my girlfriend.

I studied [Theoretical Physics](physics.html), and I'm employed as 
Data Scientist at [Voicemod](https://www.voicemod.net/). I play piano, 
I enjoy long walks, I dislike closed empty space and empty space in general.

I'm passionate about statistics and I like [messing with R](code.html). I also
eject [blog posts](blog.html) with an unknown decay rate.
