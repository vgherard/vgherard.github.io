My name is Valerio. I was born in Italy in 1992 and lived there until 2021, when I decided to move to Spain with my significant other. I'm currently based in Valencia.

I studied [Theoretical Physics](physics.html), and I am close (~ October 2021) to finish my PhD in Particle Physics, but for my future I am actively looking for a career outside of academia, as a Data Scientist / Engineer. My background provides me with a scientific and analytical mindset, which I love being able to apply and transfer to problems and challenges coming from different areas.
[As a programmer](code.html), I spend most of my coding time in R (with which I 
manage this website itself) and C++, but I also enjoy delving into Python.
