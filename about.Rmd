Valerio, class 1992, Italian based in Val√®ncia (Spain). 

Formally trained in [Theoretical Physics](physics.html), later drifted towards data analysis.

I use this space to share little notes, mainly about statistics, mathematics, physics, whatever^[*Physics is an experimental science, a part of natural science. Mathematics is the part of physics where experiments are cheap.* - V.I. Arnold, On Teaching Mathematics.]. I also like [messing with statistical code, usually in R](code.html).
