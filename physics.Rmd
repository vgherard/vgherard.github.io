## Overview

I graduated in Physics in 2017, at Universit√† La Sapienza of Rome, and obtained 
the PhD degree in Theoretical Particle Physics in 2021, at the International School for Advanced Studies (SISSA) of Trieste, Italy.

I have always felt deeply fascinated by the combination of mathematical abstraction and reductivism behind Physical Laws, which find one of their greatest expressions in Particle Physics. For this (and possibly other less conscious) reason(s) I devoted my research to this field and, especially in the last years, to theories Beyond the Standard Model of Particle Physics.

This page provides an overview of the research topics I have been primarily involved with during these years, and of my personal contributions to the various areas.

## The Standard Model

The [Standard Model](https://home.cern/science/physics/standard-model) (SM) of Particle Physics is the scientific theory which subsumes our current understanding of the sub-atomic world. According to it, all observable physical phenomena can be reduced to the interaction of few elementary constituents: quarks, leptons, gauge vectors, and the Higgs boson.

Despite many experimental validations, including the spectacular [discovery of the Higgs boson](https://home.cern/news/news/experiments/atlas-and-cms-publish-observations-new-particle) at CERN in 2012, there also exist several pieces of evidence indicating (or requiring) the presence of physics not described by the SM. Some of these hints are purely observational in nature: the existence of [Dark Matter](https://home.cern/science/physics/dark-matter), [Neutrino Masses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino) and (!) gravity, to cite just a few. In addition, there are several theoretical suggestions and puzzles which strengthen the case for Physics Beyond the SM: for example, explaining the exact numbers and features of the elementary constituents shown in the figure above.

The SM is one of the greatest intellectual achievements of the last century, and poses a similarly great challenge for the present one: to supersede it.
