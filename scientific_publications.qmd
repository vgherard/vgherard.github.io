## Particle Physics

My research activity in Particle Physics spans between years 2017 and 2022, largely overlapping with my PhD studies. The main research topics are *Non-perturbative methods in Quantum Field Theory* and *Beyond Standard Model phenomenology*. A full list of publications is available on [my iNSPIRE HEP author page](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1728353?ui-citation-summary=true). My PhD thesis can be accessed [on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00285).

Selected articles:

-   [Matching scalar leptoquarks to the SMEFT at one loop](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12525)
-   [Modular invariant dynamics and fermion mass hierarchies around $\tau = i$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08718)
-   [Solving the Bethe-Salpeter Equation in Minkowski Space for a Fermion-Scalar system](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03079)
