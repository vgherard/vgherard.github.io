## Overview

My preferred programming languages are [`R`](https://www.r-project.org/) and [`C++`](https://www.cplusplus.com/), and in most of my projects I use a combination of the two (usually via [`{Rcpp}`](http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.html)). I also enjoy delving into [`Python`](https://www.python.org/), especially when working with others on machine-learning/deep-learning related projects, either directly or again through its plenty R integrations (*e.g.* [`{reticulate}`](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/), [`{tensorflow}`](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/), [`{keras}`](https://keras.rstudio.com/)). During my research years as physicist, I made extensive use of [`Wolfram`](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) and occasionally worked with [`Fortran`](https://fortran-lang.org/).

This page contains a selected list of open-source projects, mostly but not only R packages, I'm working or have worked on.

## R packages

The R packages listed below can be installed from [my R-universe public repository](https://vgherard.r-universe.dev/).
