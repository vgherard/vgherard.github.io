## This website

This website serves as a repository for my thoughts, things I am studying or working on, and notes I have accumulated across the years. Central topics are Statistics, Mathematics and Physics[^1].

## Me

👋 **Hi — I’m Valerio.**

I’m an applied researcher and scientific software developer based in València, Spain. My work sits at the intersection of **science, modelling, and software**.

My background is in **physics**, where I specialised in particle phenomenology during my PhD. Over time, my interests expanded toward **statistics, machine learning, and computational modelling**, leading me into **data-science roles in industry** and later back into research environments.

Currently, I work within the **ERAHUMED project at the Universitat de València**, where I develop environmental simulation models and research software to support ecological risk assessment and evidence-based environmental policy.

I enjoy projects that challenge me intellectually, especially when they combine scientific thinking, algorithmic problem-solving, reproducible computational methods and real-world impact.

If you’d like to connect, you'll find contact links and [my CV](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vgherard/cv/master/cv/cv.pdf) in the navigation bar. I'm currently **open for consulting / project-based work** – feel free to reach out.
