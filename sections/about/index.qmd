## This website

This website serves as a repository for my thoughts, things I am studying or working on, and notes I have accumulated across the years. Central topics are Statistics, Mathematics and Physics[^1].

[^1]: *Physics is an experimental science, a part of natural science. Mathematics is the part of physics where experiments are cheap.* - V.I. Arnold, On Teaching Mathematics.

## Me

I’m an applied researcher and scientific software developer based in València, Spain. My work sits at the intersection of **science, modelling, and software**.

My background is in **physics**, where I specialised in particle phenomenology during my PhD. Over time, my interests expanded toward **statistics, machine learning, and computational modelling**, leading me into **data-science roles in industry** and later back into research environments.

Currently, I work within the **ERAHUMED project at the Universitat de València**, where I develop environmental simulation models and research software to support ecological risk assessment and evidence-based environmental policy.

I enjoy projects that challenge me intellectually, especially when they combine:

-   scientific thinking

-    algorithmic problem-solving

-    reproducible computational methods

-   and real-world impact
