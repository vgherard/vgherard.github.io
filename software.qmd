This page contains some selected software projects - mainly R libraries - I am currently or have been working on. See also my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/vgherard) and my [R-universe website](https://vgherard.r-universe.dev/).

## kgrams

[![CRAN status](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/kgrams)](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=kgrams) [![R-universe status](https://vgherard.r-universe.dev/badges/kgrams)](https://vgherard.r-universe.dev/) [![Website](https://img.shields.io/badge/Website-here-blue)](https://vgherard.github.io/kgrams/)

[`kgrams`](https://vgherard.github.io/kgrams/) provides tools for training and evaluating $k$-gram language models, including several probability smoothing methods, perplexity computations, random text generation and more. It is based on an C++ back-end which makes `kgrams` fast, coupled with an accessible R API which aims at streamlining the process of model building, and can be suitable for small- and medium-sized NLP experiments, baseline model building, and for pedagogical purposes.

## fcci

[![CRAN status](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/fcci)](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=fcci) [![R-universe status](https://vgherard.r-universe.dev/badges/fcci)](https://vgherard.r-universe.dev/) [![Website](https://img.shields.io/badge/Website-here-blue)](https://vgherard.github.io/fcci/)

`fcci` is an R package providing support for building [Feldman-Cousins](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.57.3873) confidence intervals.

## r2r

[![CRAN status](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/r2r)](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=r2r) [![R-universe status](https://vgherard.r-universe.dev/badges/r2r)](https://vgherard.r-universe.dev/) [![Website](https://img.shields.io/badge/Website-here-blue)](https://vgherard.github.io/r2r/)

[`r2r`](https://vgherard.github.io/r2r/) provides a flexible implementation of hash tables in R, allowing for:

-   arbitrary R objects as keys and values,
-   arbitrary key comparison and hash functions,
-   customizable behaviour (throw or return a default value) on missing key exceptions.
