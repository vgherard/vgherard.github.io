For this (and possibly other less conscious) reason(s) I devoted my research to this field and, especially in the last years, to theories Beyond the Standard Model of Particle Physics.\r\nThis page provides an overview of the research topics I have been primarily involved with during these years, and of my personal contributions to the various areas.\r\nThe Standard Model\r\nThe Standard Model (SM) of Particle Physics is the scientific theory which subsumes our current understanding of the sub-atomic world. According to it, all observable physical phenomena can be reduced to the interaction of few elementary constituents: quarks, leptons, gauge vectors, and the Higgs boson.\r\nParticles of the Standard Model of particle physics (Image: Daniel Dominguez/CERN)Despite many experimental validations, including the spectacular discovery of the Higgs boson at CERN in 2012, there also exist several pieces of evidence indicating (or requiring) the presence of physics not described by the SM. Some of these hints are purely observational in nature: the existence of Dark Matter, Neutrino Masses and (!) gravity, to cite just a few. In addition, there are several theoretical suggestions and puzzles which strengthen the case for Physics Beyond the SM: for example, explaining the exact numbers and features of the elementary constituents shown in the figure above.\r\nThe SM is one of the greatest intellectual achievements of the last century, and poses a similarly great challenge for the present one: to supersede it.\r\nMy Scientific Publications\r\nBelow you can find a complete list of my scientific publications on Particle Physics, in inverse chronological order. More details, including full pdfs and citation metrics, can be found at my iNSPIRE HEP author page.\r\nMy PhD thesis is publicly available on arXiv.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] V.
