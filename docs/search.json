Central topics are Statistics, Mathematics and Physics1.\r\nMe\r\nI am Valerio, class 1992, Italian based in València (Spain).\r\nI am generally passionate about science, and mathematical sciences in particular. I studied Physics, specializing in Particle Phenomenology, on which I did my PhD. More recently, my interests have been gravitating more around Statistics, both theoretical and applied.\r\nI worked as data scientist for a few years, finally concluding that it is not my thing. As of today (Feb. 2024), I still have to figure out what comes next.\r\nIf you want to get in touch with me, you can follow the contact links in the navigation bar above. My CV can be downloaded here.\r\n\r\nPhysics is an experimental science, a part of natural science. Mathematics is the part of physics where experiments are cheap. - V.I. Arnold, On Teaching Mathematics.↩︎\r\n",
