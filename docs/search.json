I’m currently based in Valencia.\nI studied Theoretical Physics, and I am close (~ October 2021) to finish my PhD in Particle Physics, but for my future I am actively looking for a career outside of academia, as a Data Scientist / Engineer. My background provides me with a scientific and analytical mindset, which I love being able to apply and transfer to problems and challenges coming from different areas. As a programmer, I spend most of my coding time in R (with which I manage this website itself) and C++, but I also enjoy delving into Python.\nIf you want to get in touch, you can follow the contact links in the navigation bar above. My CV can be downloaded here.\n\n\n\n",

I also enjoy delving into Python, especially when working with others on machine-learning/deep-learning related projects, either directly or again through its plenty R integrations (e.g. {reticulate}, {tensorflow}, {keras}). During my research years as physicist, I made extensive use of Wolfram and occasionally worked with Fortran.\nThis page contains a selected list of open-source projects, mostly but not only R packages, I’m working or have worked on.\nR packages\nThe R packages listed below can be installed from my R-universe public repository.

For this (and possibly other less conscious) reason(s) I devoted my research to this field and, especially in the last years, to theories Beyond the Standard Model of Particle Physics.\nThis page provides an overview of the research topics I have been primarily involved with during these years, and of my personal contributions to the various areas.\nThe Standard Model\nThe Standard Model (SM) of Particle Physics is the scientific theory which subsumes our current understanding of the sub-atomic world. According to it, all observable physical phenomena can be reduced to the interaction of few elementary constituents: quarks, leptons, gauge vectors, and the Higgs boson.\nParticles of the Standard Model of particle physics (Image: Daniel Dominguez/CERN)Despite many experimental validations, including the spectacular discovery of the Higgs boson at CERN in 2012, there also exist several pieces of evidence indicating (or requiring) the presence of physics not described by the SM. Some of these hints are purely observational in nature: the existence of Dark Matter, Neutrino Masses and (!) gravity, to cite just a few. In addition, there are several theoretical suggestions and puzzles which strengthen the case for Physics Beyond the SM: for example, explaining the exact numbers and features of the elementary constituents shown in the figure above.\nThe SM is one of the greatest intellectual achievements of the last century, and poses a similarly great challenge for the present one: to supersede it.\nMy Scientific Publications\nBelow you can find a complete list of my scientific publications on Particle Physics, in inverse chronological order.
