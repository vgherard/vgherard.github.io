We define the Gibbs free energy as:\n\n$$\nG = U + pV-TS.\n$$ The differential of $G$ is given by:\n\n$$\n\\text{d}G = \\text dU+p\\,\\text{d}V -T\\,\\text dS+V\\,\\text dp-S\\text dT.\n$$ Denoting by:\n\n$$\n\\delta W = \\text d U - T\\,\\text d S\n$$\n\nthe work done on the system in a reversible transformation, we have:\n\n$$\n\\text{d}G = \\delta W+p\\,\\text{d}V+V\\,\\text dp-S\\text dT.\n$$ If $\\delta W = -p \\,\\text d V$, this reduces to\n\n$$\n\\text{d}G = V\\,\\text dp-S\\text dT\n$$\n\nin a reversible transformation. Therefore $\\text{d} G = 0$ is a necessary condition for thermodynamic equilibrium at constant pressure and temperature.\n\nThe key observation here is that the derivation is not restricted by any means to simple hydrostatic systems (*i.e.* systems described in terms of volume and pressure *only*). The only condition for the validity of Eq. XXX is that the total external work $\\delta W = -p \\,\\text d V$.\n\nThe canonical example here is a pure substance with two phases in thermodynamic equilibrium, such as water vapor in equilibrium with liquid water. Letting $m_i,\\,p_i,\\,V_i$, with $i = 1,\\,2$ denote the masses, pressures and volumes of the two distinct phases, we have three *a priori* constraints on these quantities, namely:\n\n-   Conservation of mass $m_1 + m_2 = m$,\n-   Mechanical equilibrium $p_1 = p_2 = p$,\n-   Thermal equilibrium $T_1 = T_2 = T$,\n\nthat allow us to reduce the number of variables from six to three, which we can choose to be $p$, $T$ and $m_2$. A fourth constraint is provided by the stationarity of Gibbs potential, which yields a relation between pressure and temperature at the phase transition.\n\nLet us introduce the specific quantities:\n\n$$\n\\begin{split}\nV_i(p,T,m_i) &= m_iv_i(p,T), \\\\\nU_i(p,T,m_i) &= m_iu_i(p,T),\\\\\nS_i(p,T,m_i) &= m_is_i(p,T),\n\\end{split}\n$$ The Gibbs potential of each phase can thus be written as:\n\n$$\nG_i = m_i(u_i+pv_i-Ts_i)=m_ig_i(p,T)\n$$ and the total Gibbs potential is $G = m_1g_1 + m_2g_2$. Thermodynamic equilibrium requires $\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial m_2} = 0$, that is\n\n$$\ng_1(p,T) = g_2(p,T)\n$$ which means that $p$ and $T$ are not independent at the phase transition. If we solve the equilibrium condition for $p=p(T)$, and plug this in into $u_i = u_i(p,T)$ etc., we see that also thermodynamic specific quantities are functions of $T$ only.\n\nIf we take the differential of the previous equation, noticing that:\n\n$$\n\\text{d}g _i =-s_i\\text{d}T+v_i\\text{d}P\n$$ we obtain\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\text d P}{\\text d T} = \\dfrac{s_2 - s_1}{v_2 - v_1}\n$$ Denoting by $\\lambda \\equiv T(s_2 - s_1)$ the latent heat of the phase transition, we have:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\text d P}{\\text d T} = \\dfrac{\\lambda}{T(v_2 - v_1)}\n$$\n",
