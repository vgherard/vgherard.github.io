Thermodynamics is not really a theory describing some concrete phenomenon, but
rather a theoretical *framework*. In order to obtain quantitative predictions 
outof thermodynamics, we need some external input concerning the macroscopic 
description of some actual system, *i.e.* thermodynamic coordinates, state
equation, expression for work...

This is similar to other branches of physics: Newton's laws, quantum mechanics.
These are not really theory, but rather formalisms. Is there any fundamental 
difference between thermodynamics and the other formalisms? Do these formalisms
lead to some quantitative prediction that are independent of the specific model
for the system under study?
