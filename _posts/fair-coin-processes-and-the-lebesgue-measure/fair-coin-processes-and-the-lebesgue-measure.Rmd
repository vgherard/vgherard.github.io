```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

A sequence of binary random variables $Z_1,\,Z_2,\,\dots$ is said to be a fair coin process if:

$$
\text{Pr}(Z_1 = z_1,\,Z_{2}=z_{2},\,\dots,\, Z_{n}=z_{n}) = 2^{-n}
$$
for all $z_i \in \{0,\,1\}$.


..... Is it obvious? for instance Pr(X > 1/2) is clearly 1/2 = uniform measure
